## Key Features

### üñê Dynamic Gesture Recognition
The CONIC library offers a robust **dynamic gesture recognition** system, allowing users to interact with virtual environments through hand movements. Current gestures include popular actions like **scissors, shoot**, and more. The library is built in C# for seamless integration with Unity, giving developers an easy-to-use API for immediate use.

### üöÄ Ready for AR/VR Integration
CONIC is currently optimized for **Oculus Quest AR/VR headsets**, ensuring smooth performance and accurate gesture detection in immersive environments. As AR/VR technology evolves, so does CONIC. We also offer support for upcoming devices like **Apple Vision Pro**, **Microsoft HoloLens**, and **mobile platforms**, ensuring wide compatibility across devices.

### üîÑ Custom Gesture Training
One of the standout features of CONIC is its **custom gesture training** capability. Users can create and train their own unique gestures, adding these personalized interactions to their products. This feature allows full customization, giving developers flexibility to implement gestures that are tailored to their application needs.

### üìö Access to a Dynamic Gesture Library
Additionally, CONIC provides access to an extensive **library of over 200+ dynamic gestures**. This library covers a wide range of pre-built gestures that can be immediately integrated into your Unity project, reducing development time and giving you a head start on interaction design. In the Demo, we have just enabled 3, but we are glad to let you try this if you contact us at [david.ceepeda@tum.de](mailto:david.ceepeda@tum.de).
